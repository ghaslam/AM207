            <h3>Background</h3>

<p>The data comes from DrivenData.org. DrivenData aims to encourage data scientists from around the world to take part in online competitions to develop predictive statistical models that can address important problems in the fields of health, international development, and the environment. The data for the Tanzanian water pump competition was aggregated from the Tanzanian Ministry of Water by Taarifa, an open source platform for tracking infrastructure related issues. Despite the availability of water in Tanzania, only a third of people have access to a pipe source, and according to Jacques Morisset, an expert at the World Bank: </p>

              <blockquote>
                Maintenance of existing systems, however, has been neglected as well as the development of new delivery mechanisms, such as partnerships with private operators and communities.
              </blockquote>

              <p>In this project, we attempt to help address this issue by developing methods for predicting the operational status of water pumps and optimizing their maintenance using th 59,400 records provided in the DrivenData.org dataset. Each record includes details such as location, installer, GPS height, installing organization, payment type, water availability, and other categorical factors. Figure <a href="#1">1</a> shows the distribution of the water pumps across Tanzania.</p>

              <h3>Overview</h3>

              <p>First, we use Bayesian Methods to assign one of three categorical labels indicating the functional status each pump (functioning, functioning needs repair, and not functioning). The Bayesion models are built on training data, then used to predict the functional status for wells with unknown status. An ordered logistic model is constructed from a subset of the available parameters and comparisons are made with other Machine Learning Methods. The details of this part of the project are described <a href="simulation.html">here</a>. Metropolis-Hastings sampling is used to choose optimal values probabilistically for the each of the coefficients of the parameters and predictions are then made. Whilst the model is able to out-perform the naive baseline prediction, other Machine Learning Methods have better performance. This is possibly due to the construction of our model and improvements could be made with greater use of subject expert input, the large number of categorical factors suggests other methods are better suited to this problem.</p>

              <p>Second, we use Simulated Annealing (SA) to suggest the best route that will allow a maintenance crew to visit all of the various pumps that require repair in what is essentially  <a href="optimization.html">an optimization problem. </a> We use the latitude and longitude data of each pump as inputs for a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and add further constraints such as a fixed depot, multiple salesmen, and priority .</p>

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>

              <p>We have shown that Bayesian modelling can produce predictions for the operating status of water pumps that are significantly better than the naive baseline prediction. The approach assumes an a priori model of how the pump functions based on parameters that we believe to be significant and then updates the relative strength of each of these parameters probabilistically to converge towards to optimal values. However, we have also shown that other Machine Learning Methods can produce superior predictions based on simpler assumptions. Having developed methods for identifying faulty pumps we have demonstrated the use of simulated annealing to optimise the route that a maintenance crew can take and added constraints such as a fixed depot, and multiple crews. Interesting avenues for future work have also been suggested.</p>
