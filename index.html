            <h3>Background</h3>

<p>The data comes from DrivenData.org. DrivenData aims to encourage data scientists from around the world to take part in online competitions to develop predictive statistical models that can address important problems in the fields of health, international development, and the environment. The data for the Tanzanian water pump competition was aggregated from the Tanzanian Ministry of Water by Taarifa, an open source platform for tracking infrastructure related issues. Despite the availability of water in Tanzania, only a third of people have access to a pipe source, and according to Jacques Morisset, an expert at the World Bank: </p>

              <blockquote>
                Maintenance of existing systems, however, has been neglected as well as the development of new delivery mechanisms, such as partnerships with private operators and communities.
              </blockquote>

              <p>In this project, we attempt to help address this issue by developing methods for predicting the operational status of water pumps and optimizing their maintenance using th 59,400 records provided in the DrivenData.org dataset. Each record includes details such as location, installer, GPS height, installing organization, payment type, water availability, and other categorical factors. Figure <a href="#1">1</a> shows the distribution of the water pumps across Tanzania.</p>

              <h3>Overview</h3>

              <p>In the <a href="simulation.html">simulation part of this project</a>, we use the data and MCMC methods to simulate where civil conflicts happen in both space and time. Instead of creating a hierarchical, generative model that attempts to fit parameters for all kinds of underlying causes, we instead treat the past data as an empirical distribution from which to sample. This works out well for us, because the goal here is less to predict exactly when and where conflicts take place than to create plausible scenarios for the optimization part of the project.</p>

              <p>In the <a href="optimization.html">optimization part of this project</a>, we use the temporal/geospatial conflict occurence model in the first section as both inspiration for the aid delivery analogy and also as a source of randomly sampled data points representing geospatially distributed conflicts.</p>

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>

              <p>In each part of this problem, analytical solutions either do not exist (e.g. in the distribution of events) or are computationally infeasible (e.g. in the TSP/Knapsack optimizations). We found that using a metaheuristic such as SA converged on robust solutions in relatively short order. In the future, we would like to formulate our loss function based on real world data about refugee locations and aid distribution requirements; our methodology would not change, but the solutions would be more useful for predictive tasks. Additionally, separate models could be fit and incorporated which realistically model how much of each type of aid is needed at each conflict location. Future research might also include adding many more constraints or twists to the problem, and trying different stochastic optimization techniques such as genetic optimization, Tabu search, or ant colony optimization.</p>
