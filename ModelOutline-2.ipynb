    "###2. Ordered Logistic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to the normal logistic model which only provides outcomes of either 0 or 1, the ordered inverse logistic model (ologit) can categorise outcomes into a hierarchical series of outcomes which we translate to our functionality assessment.\n",

    "ii) as time increases, probability of not functioning increases (parts decay).\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) as height increases (h), probability of not functioning increases (increasing remoteness).\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) as number of surrounding wells decreases (w), probability of not functioning increases (this is to act as a proxy for relative proximity to population centres. It could also be possible to use population as an easier way of getting this.)\n"
